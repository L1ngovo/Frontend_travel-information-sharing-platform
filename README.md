## Some digression（一些题外话）

- This is a project that I want to write on a whim. It can be regarded as a practice, and the technology is really endless.

  这是我突发奇想要写的一个项目，算得上是练手，技术真的学无止尽，边学边写

- So the project is definitely going to be rough and I'm going to take my time optimizing it.

  所以项目肯定会很粗糙，等我慢慢优化

## Project Introduction（项目介绍）

- The project is tentatively designated as the front and back end separation project.

  项目暂定为前后端分离项目

- The frontend is expected to use Vue3 as a framework, Typescript for writing, Sass for styling, Pinia for state management, and Vite for packaging.

  前端预计将会使用Vue3作为框架，Typescript进行编写，Sass设置样式，Pinia进行状态管理，Vite进行打包

- The backend language is tentatively Java, the framework is tentatively Spring Boot, and the database is yet to be determined.

  后端使用语言暂定为Java，框架暂定Spring Boot，数据库尚未确定

- I will develop the back-end after the front-end page is basically built, because I have little knowledge about the back-end and need to learn it systematically.

  将会在前端页面大体搭建完成后进行后端的开发，因为后端的相关知识我接触甚少，需要进行系统的学习

- The estimated development time for the project is undetermined, but I hope to have some basic functionality implemented within three months.

  项目预计开发耗时未定，但我希望能在三个月内完成一些基础功能的实现
